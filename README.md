# Introduction
Homography Estimation &amp; Tracking is python project that have two main goals firstly track object using correlation filter approach and  to find the orientation using RANSAC-like methods.
There are two main approach for finding solutions : by reference image or by two successive images.

#  How to Use  :D 
Firstly the user need to pick points , then surround the regions of interest (ROI) with bounding box , in this script it's done manually since we need to check the perfect fitting to our ROI  in further steps this part will done automaticlly as object detections.

#  Flag Guide 
for each script there are flags that give some utilities , (i.e compare between results , show the keypoints , the bounding box of MOSSE tracking and others)
